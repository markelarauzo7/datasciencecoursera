# Clean Data assignment

## Introduction

This repo contains my course project to Coursera "Getting And Cleaning Data" course that is part of Data Science specialization.

There is just one script called `run_analysis.R`. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

1. Download UCI HAR zip file 
2. Read all data available
3. Do some transformations
4. Write output tidy data to a file called `tidy_df.txt`

The `CodeBook.md explains it more detailed.

## Run from command line

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the script:

  $ Rscript run_analysis.R

Look for the final dataset called as `tidy_df.txt`
